#Partials for server side rendering.

Although the server sends up full on Angular fun with the Explorer and Editor app, it also builds some common
components for each (the stuff in the sidebar).  This is where the bits for those components are kept.   

Note that this is not a public directory while it's siblings, editor and explorer, are public.
